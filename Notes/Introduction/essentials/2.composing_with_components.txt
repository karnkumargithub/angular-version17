1> components -> The basic building blocks of an angular apps. It also provides structure to the apps 
that makes easy to understand parts with clear responsiblility. Very easy to maintain and enhance.

2> We know from earlier that component's component decorator has some meta data like
selector, template or templateUrl, styles or styleUrl or styleUrls.
But from angular 14 , we have standalone: true which means the component don't depend on
module (ngModules) and it can be used anywhere in the app.

Angular is modular because of component architecture.
How we will use one component into another
1> import component at the top
2> add into the imports array in @component decorator
3> add the selector in the current component's html (template). 

// todo-list.component.ts
import {TodoListItem} from './todo-list-item.component.ts';
@Component({
  standalone: true,
  imports: [TodoListItem],
  template: `
    <ul>
      <todo-list-item></todo-list-item>
    </ul>
  `,
})
export class TodoList {}

Note -> standalone: true must be define in todo-list-item component.

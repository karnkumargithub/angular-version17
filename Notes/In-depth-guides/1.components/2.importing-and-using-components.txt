1> Angular supports two ways of making a component available to other components: as a standalone component or in an NgModule.

2> Standalone components-:
A standalone component is a component that sets standalone: true in its component metadata. Standalone components directly import other components, directives, and pipes used in their templates:

@Component({
  standalone: true,
  selector: 'profile-photo',
})
export class ProfilePhoto { }


@Component({
  standalone: true,
  imports: [ProfilePhoto],
  template: `<profile-photo />`
})

Standalone components are directly importable into other standalone components.
The Angular team recommends using standalone components for all new development.

Note: Standalone: true should be present in the component which is being imported and also in the component
which imports other standalone components.
